# RefactoringToolDevelop

Prove of concept of a Racket and Python refactoring tool, or in other words a refactoring framework.

This refactoring tool is quite fragile, be patient, double check the refactoring
and report any bug found!
Automatic refactoring is highly instable!

Installation:
Requisites: You need a python implementation for DrRacket that you can find it here:
https://github.com/pedropramos/PyonR
You can install RefactoringTool from DrRacket's Install Package dialog box with git://github.com/RafaelReia/RefactoringToolDevelop

How to Bug Report:

Create a Issue with a lable Bug
describe the bug (you can use images too!)
add an example that I can replicate
